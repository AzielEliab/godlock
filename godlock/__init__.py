"""GodLock: stress-test and resilience engine for the ABAD framework.

July 12 2026 whitepaper implementation by Collin Horton / Aziel the
Revealer of the Sealed. Shipped under GitHub user AzielEliab.

GodLock does not argue. It records, analyzes, hardens, and grows.

This package is the core + receipts engine. It is not an anonymity
network. MirageGrid and Airlock are in-process logical identities.
Forks are welcome and always allowed.
